## D3.js

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It 
enables users to produce interactive data visualizations in web browsers. In 
fact, D3 means (*"**D**ata-**D**riven-**D**ocuments"*).

D3.js makes use of the SVG, HTML, and CSS standards, which means that the 
resulting visualizations are viewable on all major modern web browsers without
the need to install any plugins. 

D3 allows you to bind data to elements on a web page and then apply 
transformations based on that data to the document, for example generating 
HTML tables, graphs and charts, geographical maps, etc.


## SVG

*Scalable Vector Graphics* (SVG) is a vector graphics format for 2-D graphics 
that allows interactivity and animation in images. The SVG specification is an 
[open standard](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) developed by the World Wide 
Web Consortium. SVG uses XML to describe graphics,which means that SVG images 
can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.SVG images may be created and
edited using any text editor, but drawing software is more often used. SVG is 
the default output format of [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), the popular 
[free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) vector drawing software.
